The RMIT Programming Club was re-founded in July 2016 to ensure that RMIT students in the city would have a place to learn and enjoy programming together.

The club continues in the tradition of programming clubs world over. With a strong focus on learning and collaboration.

The Programming Club aims to:

* Increase the interaction and collaboration between students studying or interested in programming
* Improve the technical skills of its members and prepare them for job interview questions
* To connect members with industry and networking events 

Membership is free, must be renewed once a year using the membership form on [this page](https://rusu.rmit.edu.au/Clubs/programming).

We meet up weekly, the details of when and where meetings are available on this site and the Facebook Page.
