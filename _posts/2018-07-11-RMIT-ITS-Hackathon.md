The RMIT Programming Club, along side RMIT ITS and RMIT CSIT Society, are excited to announce our first RMIT ITS Hackathon, which will be a 24 hour coding extravaganza running from the Saturday 11th August to Sunday 12th August at the Activator.

<!-- more -->

The goal of the hackathon is to create a project that encompasses the theme of “Flipped perspectives, students creating learning experiences”, which will be judged on a specific criterion by industry experts.

This event will not only revolve around designing your solution but will also include multiple games (such as Limbo), micro events and keynote presentations by industry experts. Meals and snacks will also be provided throughout your challenge as well as a neat goody bag!

We encourage students of all experience levels to register as this is an excellent opportunity for you to network yourself, as well as learn from your peers in a constructive and supportive environment.

Teams can have a maximum of 6 members, individuals can enter by themselves, but it is encouraged for them to join or form a team.

If you are looking for a team to join or needing some more team members feel free to post on to the Facebook group or discuss on Discord in the new #its_hackathon discussion channel.

Come along and prove that your group are the best amateur programmers at RMIT. Visit the [ITS Hackathon site](https://sites.rmit.edu.au/itshackathon/) to find out more details and to register.
